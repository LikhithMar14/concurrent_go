	Syntax of channels

	//Right side => Send only
	//Left side => Receive only

	only receive channel
	channel  =  make(<- chan interface{})

	only send channel

	channel = make(chan <- interface{})


	Go will implicitly convert bidirectional channels to unidirectional
	channels when needed. Hereâ€™s an example:


	var receiveChan <-chan interface{}
	var sendChan chan<- interface{}
	dataStream := make(chan interface{})

	receiveChan = dataStream
	sendChan = dataStream

	// go func(){
	// 	stringStream <- "Hello channels!"
	// }()

	// so ok if send channel hits first it waits until and unless some one receives it , and if receive channel hits first it waits until and unless some one sends to it

	/*
		stringStream := make(chan string)
			go func() {
			if 0 != 1 {
			return
			}
			stringStream <- "Hello channels!"
			}()
			fmt.Println(<-stringStream)

			when you are done with writing to a channel we should closeit using close(channel)

			then in ok we will get false this is the correct way to close the channels and inform down stream reciever that the channel is closed
